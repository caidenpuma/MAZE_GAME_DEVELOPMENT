# MAZE_GAME_DEVELOPMENT
This project implements a maze-based navigation game developed in Pyret for the CS111 Introduction to Computer Science course at Brown University. The system features a reactive game engine with portal-based teleportation mechanics, dynamic maze loading from external configuration files, and comprehensive collision detection.
